# Magic Crystal Ball
A Magic Crystal Ball is a fortune-telling/advice-seeking tool that has made its way into popular culture as a novelty item. It will give you answers and predictions to any question you can throw at it, but these responses may or may not be true. In fact, some of the returns it gives are purposefully ambiguous and allow the user to make up their own mind about what may or may not happen. Different responses will be shown every time you load the page.
